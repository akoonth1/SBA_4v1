## Requirements



- **Star designs and folders**: Star your most important items by selecting the star icon on a design or folder.
- **Use the fetch API or Axios**: Communicate with an external web API. Use the data provided by this API to populate your application's content and features. **(20%)**
- **Create user interaction with the API**: Implement a search feature, paginated gallery, or similar. This feature should use GET requests to retrieve associated data. **(15%)**
- **Enable user manipulation of data within the API**: Use POST, PUT, or PATCH requests. Ensure your chosen API supports this feature before beginning. **(15%)**
- **Make use of Promises and async/await syntax**: Use these as appropriate. **(15%)**
- **Organize your JavaScript code**: Use at least three (3) different module files, and import functions and data across files as necessary. **(3%)**
- **Ensure the program runs as expected**: Avoid any undesired behavior caused by misunderstanding of the JavaScript event loop (such as race conditions, API calls being handled out of order, etc.). **(5%)**
- **Create an engaging user experience**: Use HTML and CSS. **(5%)**
- **Ensure that the program runs without errors**: Comment out things that do not work, and explain your blockers - you can still receive partial credit. **(10%)**
- **Commit frequently to the git repository**. **(5%)**
- **Include a README file**: This should contain a description of your application. **(2%)**
- **Level of effort displayed**: Show creativity, presentation, and user experience. **(5%)**

### Project Description

This project is a morning information app, meant to inform and entertain you. The app is  split into 8-9 pieces calling across several apis. Cors-anywhere was used to get around the limitations of only using Javascript. Please enable https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo before starting the application for full functionality. Note 429 errors can occur from calling an api too often. For the quote section of the app you may need to unblock the origin url for full functionality.

#### Objectives
- Use a form of promise(Fetch, Axios)
- Use async and await to properly control the event-loop.
- Use at least three (3) different module files, and import functions and data across files as necessary
-  Implement a search feature, paginated gallery, or similar. This feature should use GET requests to retrieve associated data.

### Technologies Used
